# Portfolio - NOT FINISHED
A small showcase of some of the works I've done 

## Recommended works to view:
###  example of java code (May 2025) - soft2
###  example of python code (December 2024) - an example of various different problems coded in python
    1. small example of string manipulation 
    2. use of data structures and 3d object properties to manipulate those data structures 
    3. file and dictionary maniputation to translate data from a file into a dictionary
    4. use of OOP to create a class for a puzzle game and determine its solvability with a recursive algorithm
###  Gravity simulator (June 2024) - good view of a large project, example of database handling with php and mySQL:
    1. full website viewable through "Simulation Website Title.HTML"
       login system will not work on non local device however php code is viewable 
       javascript code block was translated from python so code style should be ignored
       CSS sheet also avalible through "Simulation StyleSheet.CSS" however not main focus 
    2. python code viewable through "Gravity simulation.py", very heavy commenting and alot of repeated concepts
       updated reacently to make it more readable but look at Dec 25 example for more recent python code
    3. PHP code avalible to view through different pages, not very advanced due to project requirements 
###  One Small Step (March 2023) - example of code produced under a time limit in an unfamiliar enviroment
    1. look at home
