# Portfolio
A small showcase of some of the works I've done 

Recommended works to view:
  Gravity simulator (June 2024) - good view of a large piece of code:
    1. full website viewable through "Simulation Website Title.HTML"
       login system will not work on non local device 
       javascript code block was translated from python so code style should be ignored
       CSS sheet also avalible through "Simulation StyleSheet.CSS" however not main focus 
    2. python code viewable through "Gravity simulation.py"
    3. PHP code avalible to view through different pages
